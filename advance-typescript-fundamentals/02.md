`unknown` - is another universal type in TS, this means, all types can be asigned except with unknown you have to do assertion if you will be changin the type, thus with unknown definition will narrow to specific type.

`any` - unlike with unknown, you can change the value with different types and there will be no issue, thus, it `unknown` is always preferred
