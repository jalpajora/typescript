## Private fields

- Class fields are public by default, if you want fields to be not accessible outside Class you can do the following
- language targeting should be es2015, requirement in TS because it is using WeakMap to define private properties

### Declaring private field options:

#### 1. Hash name (#value field)

- if you want to make them private use `#` before the variable name
- pronounced as "hash value"

<pre>
class Counter {

  #value = 0;
</pre>

#### 2. private key

<pre>
class Counter {

  private value = 0;
</pre>
