#### `!` - definite assignment assertion

- exclamation mark after property name
- problem with this approach: if we dont actually assign the property, TS will not able to determine that you did not initialize the property
- recommended to initialize the property via constructer or assign value to the property directly instead of this approach

<pre>
  username!: string;

  constructor(username: string) {
    this.setUsername(username);
  }
</pre>
